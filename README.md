# My personal blog

I just wanted some kind of self-maintained, central place to collect some things and a blog appeared to be the most fitting solution for me.

Based on [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) since I wanted to try out both for quite some time. The blog posts are based on markdown files, all pages are statically generated and everything is built and published to Github pages through Github actions.
