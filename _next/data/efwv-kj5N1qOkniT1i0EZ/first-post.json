{"pageProps":{"postData":{"slug":"first-post","title":"First Post","date":"2022-02-21","tags":["blog","development","meta"],"description":"The very first post in my new blog.","content":"\nNew blog and therefore the obligatory \"first post\" post.\n\nThere's no real theme to this blog and I won't post regularly or frequently. Well, I think this blog might even get abandoned sooner than later.\n\nBut for now I had the urge that I wanted a self-maintained, central place to collect some things and a blog appeared to be the most fitting solution for me. I could have gone the easy route and just use Jekyll in combination with Github, but I always feel like I don't have all of the control using one of these options.\n\nThat's why I cobbled together this thingy here and also finally took a look at Nextjs and Tailwind. This blog uses markdown files for its posts, all pages are statically generated and everything is built and published to Github pages through Github actions.\n\nYou can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/stffffn/blog).\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
